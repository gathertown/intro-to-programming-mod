# intro-to-programming-mod

repo to go with this tutorial: https://gathertown.notion.site/Getting-Started-With-Gather-Mods-94fd4a62bf074cfaaf7ca91edd184a76

the goal of this tutorial is to be a very agressive intro to programming in JavaScript,
and then a tutorial of how to use JS for ~fun and for profit~ to make Gather mods

this tutorial isn't perfect, but hopefully better than nothing?
I (@npfoss) wrote it hastily in a couple hours

feel free to give feedback as an Issue on this repo
