  - order of operations

this is the hardest and most important level
*/

/* REMOVE ME TO BEGIN LEVEL 4

// basically everything that isn't a number, boolean, or string is an object

// objects can bundle multiple variables together. so convenient!
// for example, this object hold a variable named x and one named y

let obj = { x: 5, y: 8 };
console.log(obj);
// sometimes is more readable to wrtie them like this -- it's ok that it takes more than one line, the {} indiciate that it's all one command

  x: 5, // why is it : instead of = like before? what's going on is a little different even though it's practically the same
  y: 8,
};
console.log(obj);
// ok but how do we actually use those variables?
console.log("obj.x, three ways");
console.log(obj.x); // the . is how we access stuff inside an object. this isn't magic, it's part of the syntax
// order of operations
// ok what's actually happening here?
// 1. obj is representing the actual data { x: 5, y: 8 }
// 2. ({ x: 5, y: 8 }).x says "give me that variable you call x"
// 3. x evaluates to 5 -- it is a simple primitive
// 4. console.log(5) prints it out as usual

// x is still the real, normal variable we know and love!
obj.x = 7;
console.log(obj.x);
obj.x = obj.x * 2;
console.log(obj.x);
// just like a normal variable, but we access it through obj.

// what happens if we try one that doesn't exist?
// console.log(obj.fakeVariable); // comment me in to find out

//

//

//                 take a breath

//

//

// if you want to get freaky, you can even put objects inside objects :O
let biggerObj = {
  z: 100,
  smallerObj: obj, // whoa. obj is now stored in here, under the variable named "smallerObj"
};
console.log("bigger object??");
console.log(biggerObj);
console.log(biggerObj.smallerObj);
console.log(biggerObj.smallerObj.x); // it's all still there :)
// not just a party trick: it's the real obj inside there. we can change it and it will show up in biggerObj
obj.x = -2;
console.log(biggerObj.smallerObj.x); // don't be fooled that obj looks like it's never mentioned here -- we just named it smallerObj as far as biggerObj is concerned

let biggerObjCopy = biggerObj as any; // ignore this line -- it make it harder to catch errors, so I can demo something
// we just made a copy of biggerObj that is less safe. all of the data is the same

// what if we get rid of smallerObj?
console.log("getting rid of smallerObj");
biggerObjCopy.smallerObj = undefined; // makes it not exist :O
// console.log(biggerObjCopy.smallerObj.x); // an error!

// ? to the rescue
// sometimes, we're going to get dirty unreliable objects from other people's code. the ? operator can save us from these possibly undefined variables
console.log(biggerObjCopy.smallerObj?.x); // no error -- just undefined
// order of operations check
// 1. biggerObjCopy.smallerObj becomes smallerObj, the variable we stored there
// 2. smallerObj? checks if it's undefined. it is, so we stop there

// what if it was defined?
let definedObj = {
  smaller: {
    x: 5,
  },
};
console.log(definedObj.smaller?.x); // ? has no effect, does what we expected
// order of operations check
// 1. definedObj.smaller becomes smaller, the variable we stored there
// 2. smaller? checks if it's undefined. it isn't, so keep going
// 3. smaller.x becomes x, the variable we put there
// 4. x is 5, console.log prints it out

ok, this is the point at which things are going to stop making sense.
We're going to start using commands which do very complicated things under the hood, and what's going on doesn't actually matter --
what matters is taking these commands we don't understand, and combining them in ways we do understand.
